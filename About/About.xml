	<description>More beds for your polyamorous pawns!

This mod is a spiritual successor of Polygamy Beds by Joseph with code being completely rewritten. 

Features:
     - Triple, quadra sleeping spots and bedrolls (avaliable from the start);
     - Triple, quadra beds and royal beds (require 'Complex Furniture' to be researched, royal beds also require 8 skill in Construction);
     - Penta royal bed (requires 'Complex Furniture' to be researched, 8 skill in Construction).
Stats are carefully balanced to be in line with Vanilla beds, graphics is updated.
 
Known issues
     - Some other mods may interfere with game's miniaturisation mechanics thus making it possible to install/uninstall sleeping spots (and you may get also get messages about 'Outdoor penalty' when placing sleeping spots outside).
Solution: move this mod above those mods.
     - Modded Royal Titles may not recognise larger beds as suitable substitutes for double beds of that type.
Solution: move this mod below the mod adding the titles.
     - Pawns with a Spouse-Only Physical Love precept cannot sleep with multiple spouses at the same time unless their spouses are also married to each other.
Solution: this is Vanilla behaviour outside the scope of this mod. [SIC] Co-Spousal Relations is one mod that addresses this.
 
Please report any problems and/or inconsequences!
